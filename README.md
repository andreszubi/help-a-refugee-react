# Host a refugee
# by Andres Zubizarreta , Eric Coimbra and Tatiana Toledo

# Description
The host a refugee project was inspired by the ongoing crisis happening around the world. We felt compelled by this, and we felt that we needed to create a website where we can connect people to host refugees in their homes to help them flee from any life-threatening situation they may be experiencing in their country and to be able to move to a new home to build a better future for their family.

On the website anyone can sign up to be become a host and publish a room, apartment, or house that they can share with any refugee who may be in need. 

Refugees will be able to make a profile on this website for free and to search for a home that they can easily book by just a click of a button. This will send an email to the host with the refugeeâ€™s information and then they may contact them to help facilitate details to help them.
